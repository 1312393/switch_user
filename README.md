    SwitchUser.setup do |config|
      # provider may be :devise or :authologic
      config.provider = :devise

      # avaliable_users is a hash, 
      # key is the model name of user (:user, :admin, or any name you use), 
      # value is a block that return the users that can be switched.
      config.available_users = { :user => lambda { User.all } }

      # what field should be displayed on select box
      config.display_field = :email

      # controller_guard is a block, 
      # if it returns true, the request will continue, 
      # else the request will be refused and returns "Permission Denied"
      config.controller_guard = lambda { |current_user, request| Rails_env == "development" }

      # view_guard is a block, 
      # if it returns true, the switch user select box will be shown, 
      # else the select box will not be shown
      config.view_guard == lambda { |current_user, request| Rails.env == "development" }

      # redirect_path is a block, it returns which page will be redirected 
      # after switching a user.
      config.redirect_path = lambda { |request, params| '/' }
    end
